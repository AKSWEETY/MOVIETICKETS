This Ticket Sale project is structured using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework and includes 3 controllers, 5 models, and 6 views organized by action methods. Here's a brief overview of its structure, suitable for a Git repository description:

Overview:
The project allows users to view and purchase event tickets through a simple web interface. It features a Home, Events, and About Us page, all set within a shared layout.

Controllers:
HomeController: Handles the Home and AboutUs pages. It retrieves and displays basic project details and binds data from the Category model to the AboutUs view.
EventsController: Manages event data with two main methods:
EventList: Retrieves and displays all events or filters them by category.
Details: Shows detailed information for a single event.
CartController: Manages the ticket purchasing process with two primary actions:
Buy: Displays the ticket purchase form.
Confirmation: Displays the ticket purchase confirmation with price and order details.
Models:
EventService: Handles the logic for retrieving events and categories.
ListViewModel: Aggregates events, categories, and the selected category for the view.
BuyTicketsModel: Contains the properties needed for the ticket purchase form and methods to calculate the total price and discounts.
Category & Event: Represent the event and category entities.
Views:
Home: Displays project details.
AboutUs: Displays information about the project using data from the Category model.
EventList: Shows events and their categories. Each event can be selected for more details.
EventDetails: Displays detailed information about a single event.
Buy: Allows users to input purchase details for tickets.
Confirmation: Displays the order summary after ticket purchase.
Key Features:
Event Filtering: Events are categorized, and users can filter by category.
Ticket Purchase: A form is used to purchase tickets, with calculations for discounts (e.g., senior discount) and additional charges (e.g., delivery mode).
Dynamic Views: Based on user input, the views dynamically update to show the relevant event information and ticket prices.
This structure follows the MVC design pattern and utilizes Razor views for dynamic content generation. The HomeController serves as the default controller, with EventController and CartController handling the core functionalities related to event listing and ticket purchase.
